Here all relevant theory on graphs will be presented, only graphs used for simulation will be presented, and the methods for creating them will be described in section \ref{sec:creating_graphs}. This chapter is heavily inspired by my project thesis "Beliefs and the Propagation of Misinformation in Social Networks" at NTNU in 2025 \cite{project_thesis}. Specifically, this chapter is inspired by subsection 3.1 "Graph Theory".
