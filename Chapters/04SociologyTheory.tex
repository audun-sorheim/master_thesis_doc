This chapter will contain all the relevant theory on humans, humans behavior and more which help drive the dynamics of the DHT model. This chapter is heavily inspired by my project thesis "Beliefs and the Propagation of Misinformation in Social Networks" at NTNU in 2025 \cite{project_thesis}. Specifically, this chapter is inspired by subsections 2.1-2.5 "Existing Literature". 

That section covers a lot of the literature that was researched for the project thesis, relevant to the model or not. This chapter will mostly contain the topics related to the numerical model and simulations.
